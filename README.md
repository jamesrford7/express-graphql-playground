# express-graphql-playground

A bit of GraphQL fun that's fast turning in to a beast I can't leave alone. There's a react/relay front-end as well.

As usual for a node app:
1. Clone repo
2. ```npm install```

GraphQL Server (from root dir):

1. ```npm start```
2. navigate to http://localhost:4000/graphql
3. Try a query (can see possibilities in schema.js)

Client (from web):

1. ```webpack-dev-server --progress --colors```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
